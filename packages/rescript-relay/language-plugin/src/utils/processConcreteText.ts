/**
 * Right now, we need to post-process the generated JS some. We do the following here:
 * - Alter all require()-operations to point at our generated files. This is because
 *   Relay by default outputs require calls for @refetchable operations which point to
 *   where the equivalent JS module would be located, and that we're not currently allowed
 *   to alter the generated module names and import paths. I've considered PRing support for
 *   altering the paths "for real" through the language plugin, but this actually seems to
 *   be working fine.
