This page details how to set up the best possible development environment for RescriptRelay.

## Editor extensions

First of all, make sure you have [rescript-vscode](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-vscode) set up for proper language support.

If you're using VSCode, you are **highly encouraged** to use our [dedicated VSCode extension](vscode-extension).

_WIP, more info about other editors than VSCode coming soon_.
