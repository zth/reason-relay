_This section is a WIP_.

Relay, and by extension RescriptRelay, expects your schema to conform to certain practices for it to work optimally. The practices are outlined in [the Relay server specification](using-with-schemas-that-dont-conform-to-the-relay-spec). This page will discuss what to do when your schema does not conform to the specification, but you still want to use RescriptRelay.

## Global Object Identification and the `Node` interface

The Relay specification expects all your GraphQL objects to have _globally unique IDs_. _Work in progress..._.
